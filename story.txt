There once was a boy named Karam who wanted to sail the seas as a pirate.
Karam and his family lived in Northern Africa during the early 1400s when 
technological advances were few and chaos was abundant. However, Karam lived 
for the unpredictable. He'd try his best to pretend to be a pirate by doing 
things like putting eye makeup on, wearing raggedy clothes, and yelling "argh" 
when he could. Karam's parents think he's going through a phase, but Karam 
truly believes he will be a pirate when he grows up. 
One day, Karam was on a boat sailing around the coast. Right about then, he saw
a pirate hoard attacking merchant ships carrying spices, gold and other valuable food supplies. He saw the pirates swiftly loot the ship and then he followed them with his 
boat to an island a few miles away. The pirates then gave all the loot to the poor and
famished and sailed away.This only made Karam respect and admire pirates more. 
Later, one day, Karam's father went fishing to make a living. Unfortunately, he was involved in a war between pirates and died.
His mother passed away soon because of too much grief.
At that time, Karam realized not all pirates deserved his respect.
He was raised by his grandpa and became stronger and stronger.
He decided to become a pirate and revenge for his parents.
Finally, he achieved his goal and became a pirate who helped the poor.
